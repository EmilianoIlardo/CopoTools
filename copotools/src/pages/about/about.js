                Coder Toolkit is born as a result of developers trying to find a good suite of free
                developer tools that we often need, and sometimes they are all in different places,
                without the ability to save the output for the next time, or to configure some settings
                as if it was our favorite IDE. We hope you enjoy using them as much as we enjoyed building
                them for you.

                As part of this effort, we also will keep them free, only showing ads to try and cover hosting services for the app.
